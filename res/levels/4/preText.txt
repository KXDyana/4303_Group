The IFIB shuttle are going to the Federal District to increase the defense forces for the anniversary of the Interstellar Federation. During the voyage sleep period, you are writing the report of the latest investigation. Suddenly your room is powered off. You opened the door and found that it was quiet and dark. No one is around. Where are your colleagues? You check the communication equipment and find no signal. A sound slips in the darkness, you took out the flashlight which was still in your jacket pocket and turned it on. There was no sign of anyone. Suddenly a gust of wind hits from the back of your head, you dodge it quickly without thinking, and hit it with a backhand shotâ€”there are too much strange things these days, and you have accumulated enough vigilance. In the dark you saw it's a humanoid siren. Surprisingly, it doesn't scream and stand still like other sirens, but gives out rhythmically howls and rushes to fight with you.
