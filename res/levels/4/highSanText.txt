Your enemy is losing its ground. Your hand cannon is about to finish accumulating power, while it suddenly dodges and runs away. On the way of pursuit, you meet other investigators who just came back from a meeting. You told them about the intruder. The whole ship entered the first level of alert, but the siren disappeared without a trace. Investigators have identified several breaches in the plumbing system, which they believe was a premeditated attack, possibly from the same group your brother is pursuing. The attackers have fled along the pipeline system.
