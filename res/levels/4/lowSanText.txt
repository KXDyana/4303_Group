Your enemy is losing its ground. The howling of the intruder penetrates the earphone, causing you a lot of mental burden. But you unexpectedly find that those sound attacks seem to have a pattern, as if it is using the howls to punch you. Moreover, it seems that the monster knows the function of your headset, trying to destroy it over and over again. "……Little bastard! Why don't you just submit obediently like your brother!" You seem to hear some words in the howling.
Your hand cannon is about to finish accumulating power, while it suddenly dodges and runs away. On the way of pursuit, you meet other investigators who just came back from a meeting. You told them about the intruder. The whole ship entered the first level of alert, but the siren disappeared without a trace. Investigators have identified several breaches in the plumbing system, which they believe was a premeditated attack, possibly from the same group your brother is pursuing. The attackers have fled along the pipeline system.
