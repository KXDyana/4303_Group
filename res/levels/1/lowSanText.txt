"No!!! —Wait!!!" In a trance, you seem to hear the siren screaming through the earphones. "It’s Nyarlathotep who hired me! I also know they kidnapped several investigators! I—" Investigators? You froze for a moment. At this moment, the siren rushes towards the porthole glass. Your hand cannon missed its vitals, and it crashes through the porthole and escapes. The huge air pressure difference almost knocks you off the ground, and you see the star harbor guard ships approaching quickly and spraying the repair gel to the broken window.
The guard ships escort the shuttle to the star harbor, in where you underwent a series of investigations. You report the encounter to your superiors. For some reason, you feel that your superior is a bit indifferent about the event. You didn't think much, after putting down your luggage, you immediately go to the pub mentioned in your brother's letter, looking for a croupier named Sam.
