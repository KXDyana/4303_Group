You have no idea why there is a siren in this hidden place in the desert. Siren likes moist, organic-filled environments, as well as places with lots of people. Anyway, you think this is a hidden stronghold of Nyarlathotep, where they processed some shady things about siren and the people they took. You notified the Interstellar Federal Investigation Bureau, and soon the IFIB shuttle come near the planet. You and several other investigators give this place a thorough investigation.
