The flying boat landed on the periphery of the relic. The relic is an ancient city in the middle of the desert. A tall stone castle was embedded in the steep red cliffs. You turn on the flashlight and enter the stone castle. weathered stone pillars and stone carvings stand tall, but there is nothing else. You look around and find nothing of value. Suddenly, you notice that a brazier on the pillar seems to show signs of recent use. You investigate the surrounding area carefully and discover a secret door, the surrounding ground is well disguised. There it is! You open the secret door and go down the stairs. From the lower part of the stone castle, there are some faint sounds of running water, and some weird rustling. You go down to the bottom.  It is an empty basement, with traces of many people's lives. You are about to search carefully, when suddenly a black shadow flashes in front of youâ€”it is a siren!
