The battle was fierce, and the black monster went mad when it saw you. You and several investigators work together, but still can't defeat the sirens in the hall. At this very moment, another humanoid monster suddenly jumped out from the background—incredibly, it is wearing a set of Interstellar Federation standard equipment! It jumps into the air and punches the black monster as its face. More standard monsters jump out, killing all the sirens in the venue. Your superior orders your team to evacuate the battle and hand it over to the “military special force”.
After the incident, the IFIB locked down the venue to investigate the siren's presence and explain the sudden appearance of the monster army to the public. You saw many of the businessmen who were lucky enough to escape showed a feverish interest in the military monsters.
You checked the name list of the investigators in the business hall, but didn’t find William’s name. You talked to your superior, who claimed that William was involved in military special operations, and was temporarily out of the bureau's custody. A few days later, you receive a dead list of the attack. William's name was on. Your superiors sent you a condolence letter, telling you that William was killed in a failed undercover operation. Along with the letter came a pension and a month's paid vacation. You are very sad, but you still feel very confused. It must be Nyarlathotep who killed your brother. After your reinstatement, you devote more efforts to the elimination of siren.
