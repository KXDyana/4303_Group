The IFIB shuttle finally landed in the port of the Federal District. Your superior assigned you to the team that guards the business exhibition hall for the anniversary. 
The exhibition hall is bustling with people who came to carry out business cooperation. You observe the guests coming and going. Suddenly, you catch a familiar figure. William? Is that your elder brother? You are about to catch up that guy when the conference broadcast starts. "Ladies and gentlemen, please attention. The anniversary ceremony is about to begin. Please go to the B3 venue to attend the ceremony. The ceremony will be held in the B3 venue." The flow of people suddenly surged, you receive the notice of relocation, and have to go to the B3 venue.
The ceremony goes on well. The speaker's lengthy speech makes you a little irritated. That familiar figure appeared in your field of vision again—William! He stands among the reporters, looks at the stage. Something is wrong—you push your way through the crowd. But, before you get there, things have changed. A panic scream waves suddenly spread out from the crowd in front of you. You look up—a two-meter-tall humanoid black monster suddenly appears among the reporters! At the same time, several sirens’ screaming burst out in the crowd, frantically attacking the innocent people around. You immediately realize that this is a terrorist attack! Cannon in hand, you start fight.
