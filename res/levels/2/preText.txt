Sam is your brother's friend. You go to the pub to inquire, only to find out that Sam has not come to work for several days. The bartender gives you an address of Sam. Samâ€™s small broken apartment is in a crappy block. The mailbox at the door is full of newspapers and leaflets. You even find some marks left by thief. What's going on with Sam? Did he went on  a spur-of-the-moment trip? Just as you were thinking, you suddenly hear a noise in the room. Someone is there! You take out the hand cannon. This standard equipment issued by the Interstellar Federation will undoubtedly freeze any burglar. You silently counted three, two, one, and kicked the old iron gate: "Don't move!"
Among the debris on the floor, a wriggling figure slowly stand up from behind the overturned table and chair. A floating, bloated siren, waving its tentacles, screaming in shock. How could there be a siren in Sam's house? ? ? You don't have time to think, put on the headphones and start fighting!
