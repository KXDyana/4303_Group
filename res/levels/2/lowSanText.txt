The screaming waves hit your eardrums. Siren's yelling became more and more intense, through the earphones, you barely recognized the words it repeats: "……Don't inject me with that!! ...Investigator... You investigator!! No...William save me!! Save me! William!! AhAhAhAhAh—"
You nearly stunned. What the hell was going on in this apartment? Is that monster Sam? The situation does not allow you to think again, you have heard the painful cries of the affected neighbor residents. You raise then hand cannon and kill siren with one shot. Amongst the flesh and blood, you notice a metallic object. You pick it up and find that it is a voice recorder. It still has electricity. You press the play button. It is William's voice — "Christa...listen, Christa, no matter what happened, don't look into where I go or what happened to me... If possible, quite the job and go back to town. Open a hot dog shop, mom is still waiting for you. Christa, you must listen to your brother’s word."
You search the entire room and find a letter left by your brother. The letter tells you to go to a relic on a nearby planet. You suspect that there are more clues of your brother. You might be able to understand the reason for all the strange things that you encountered along the way. You report the situation to the Star harbor’s Investigation Bureau, packed your bags, headed to the relic with a federal flying boat.
